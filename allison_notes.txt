NOTES for website:

Set navigation bar items: themes/hugo-creative-themes/layouts/partials/nav.html
Overall front page layout: themes/hugo-creative-themes/layouts/index.html
Individual sections: themes/hugo-creative-themes/layouts/partials/
Main titles/headers updated in: config.toml
Most images: hugo-creative-themes/static/img/

When adding a new page: Need to update in...

- nav.html (add to navbar)
- config.toml (add section)
- index.html (add section in correct position)
- remember in the html top line to add id = "match_id_name" so it knows where to navigate to!
