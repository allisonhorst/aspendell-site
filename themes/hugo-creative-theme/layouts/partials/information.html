                <h4><b>Are Aspendell roads plowed in the winter?</b></h4>
                <p>The Inyo County Road Department has <a href="https://www.inyocounty.us/snow_removal.htm">posted policies</a> for snow removal in Aspendell. The general policy states that snow removal will "occur during daylight hours only and after a minimum of three inches of snow has accumulated on the county roadway. Three inches on a deck or in a yard does not mean that there is three inches on the roadway. Snow may not build up as rapidly on the black pavement." Depending on snowfall location, access, safety, and available resources, <b>residential streets in Aspendell may not be prioritized for snow removal in some cases.</b></p>
                <br>

                <h4><b>If my driveway is snowed-in, can I park on Aspendell roads during the winter?</b></h4>
                <p>No. Keep vehicles, equipment and landscaping feature off the streets during snow removal months (generally November through April or May).</p>

                <h4><b>How do I get an Aspendell mailbox?</b></h4>
                <p>Mailboxes are associated with <b><i>parcels</i></b>, not property owners, and cannot be transferred once assigned. There are currently no remaining available mailboxes in Aspendell, so you may want to consider a P.O. Box at the Bishop Post Office.</p>
                <br>

                <h4><b>Does Aspendell have a home owners association?</b></h4>
                <p>No. There is no Aspendell HOA. The Aspendell Property Owners Association (APOA) is a group of volunteers who organize community events, facilitate services and disseminate information to the community. There are no dues to be a member of the APOA - if you own property in Aspendell, you are automatically a member!</p>

                <h4><b>Is there cell phone coverage in Aspendell?</b></h4>
                <p>Short answer: no. The occasional text message will get through (depending on weather, wind, fairy dust, planetary alignment, etc.) -- but plan on no cell reception up here. Make communication plans accordingly.</p>

<h4><b>Why am I a baking failure up here?</b></h4>
<p>Due to lower atmospheric pressure at higher altitude, water boils at a lower temperature and evaporation increases. This causes leavening agents (baking powder, yeast, etc.) to expand too quickly, which makes baked goods rapidly rise, then collapse. If your cakes and cookies look deflated, see below for some high-altitude baking recipes and tips:</p>
